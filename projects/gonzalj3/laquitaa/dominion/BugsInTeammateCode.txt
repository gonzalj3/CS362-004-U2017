 I found two bugs. The first bug was in the smithy function. The bug was that a 
 conditional statement existed that determine the number of time a card is drawn.
 The smithy card asks for the player that plays it to draw three more cards. 
 The conditional statement incorrectly stated that the for loop it was part of
 would execute the draw function if the counter was less than or equal to 3, when 
 the counter started at 0. This would result in the for loop executing the draw 
 card four times instead of it executing three times. The second bug pertained to 
 the adventurer's card's action. The card is meant to draw cards from the player's 
 deck until two treasure cards are found. The bug in the re-factor code was that 
 the conditional statement that determine whether the card that was drawn was a 
 treasure card did not include gold as a treasure card. As a result, the 
 adventurer card would cause the player to discard treasure cards that should 
 have been drawn.
